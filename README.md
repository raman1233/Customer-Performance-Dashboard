# Customer-Performance-Dashboard
This project analyze Customer Data with various Perspective
Excited to share my latest Customer Performance Dashboard! 📊 This project was a deep dive into understanding customer behavior and extracting actionable insights.
Here's a glimpse into the journey:
•	🎨 Custom Design: I leveraged PowerPoint to craft a visually engaging background, aiming for a clean and insightful presentation (as seen in both the Dark and Light Theme variations!).
•	⚙️ Robust Data Modeling: A significant part of this project involved meticulous data modeling to ensure data integrity and efficient analysis.
•	🧠 DAX Power: I expanded my knowledge by implementing various DAX formulas to create new measures, unlocking key performance indicators like Average Customer Age and Total Customer count.
•	🔍 Insight-Driven Visualizations: Each visual serves a specific purpose: 
o	Average Customer Age & Total Customer: Provides a fundamental understanding of our customer base.
o	Customers With/Without Children: Segments the customer base to understand family demographics and their potential impact on purchasing behavior.
o	Esteemed Buyers: Highlights the top-performing customers, crucial for targeted engagement and retention strategies.
o	Revenue Segmented by Age Group: Identifies key age demographics driving revenue, informing marketing and product strategies.
o	Customer Profiling: Offers insights into different customer segments (Loyal, Periodic, VIP), allowing for tailored approaches.
o	Earning based on Gender: Analyzes revenue distribution by gender, potentially revealing important trends.
o	Country Filter: Enables dynamic exploration of customer performance across different regions (using Canada as an example here).
This dashboard aims to provide a holistic view of customer performance, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance engagement, optimize strategies, and ultimately drive growth.
